# Latch Design

**Learning Objective : Using 0continos assignment and blocking/non-blocking assignments to model basic latches and their test benches.**

1. SR-Latch design using continuos assignment and its testbench for verification.
2. D- Flip flop design with synchronous set and reset with non-blocking assignments.
3. Modelling a simple clk using loop in testbench.
