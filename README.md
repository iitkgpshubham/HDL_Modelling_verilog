# HDL_Modelling_verilog

**Learning objective of this project**
1. To explore and learn *Verilog*  language and design methodology
2. Exploring hierarchial design, behavioral design, structural design and user defined primitive design of both combinational and sequential circuits.
3. Exploring and learning the modelling of FSMs and ASMs sing verilog.
4. Partitioning the design at datapath and controller level.

5. *Future work : Implementing pipelining concepts and learn processor design techniques*


**General Instruuction :**
- Every folder is provided with their own README.md file which describes the design
- Every design also has their testbench to test their correctness.
- Compiler and simulator used *iverilog*, waveform viewer used "GTKWave", both are open source.
- Course followed : "[NPTEL : Hardware modelling using verilog](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105165/)"
- Book referred : Digital Design by Mano and Ciletti.
